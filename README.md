# Lung-cancer-detection-using-3DCNN
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Hence, the survival rate of patients can be increased by early diagnosis.Recently, machine learning methods
on Computed Tomography (CT) images have been used in the diagnosis of lung cancer to accelerate the diagnosis process and assist physicians. The primary objective the project is to present two new methods that classifies the Lung Cancer malignancy estimation from an input CT images with better accuracy than the state-of-the art methods for Lung Cancer
Detection, one based on 3D Convolution Neural Network and another based on Transfer
learning which can reduce the false positive rate while providing a high sensitivity in detecting lung cancer.There are some state-of-the art methods for Lung Cancer detection on
LIDC/IDRI datasets but their accuracy are not that good.
